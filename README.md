To run the provided JavaScript code, follow these steps:

First, ensure that Node.js is installed on your computer. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website. Once installed, verify the installation by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing node -v. This command will display the version number of Node.js if it's correctly installed.

Next, create a new JavaScript file to hold your code. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create a file named polynomial.js. Paste the provided JavaScript code into this file and save it. This code contains functions to decode values, perform Lagrange interpolation, and compute the constant term of a polynomial.

After saving your file, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved polynomial.js. Use the cd command to change directories. For example, if you saved the file on your desktop, you might use cd Desktop to navigate there.

To execute the JavaScript file, run the command node polynomial.js in your terminal or command prompt. This will invoke Node.js to execute the script. Once the code runs, the output, which is the calculated constant term of the polynomial, will be displayed in the terminal.

Finally, verify the output displayed in the terminal. It should match the expected results based on the input JSON data. If you encounter any errors, ensure that Node.js is properly installed and that the JavaScript code is free of syntax errors. Adjustments to the file location or code might be necessary if errors persist.
