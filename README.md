# Running the Polynomial Calculation Code

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your computer. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
   - Download and install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify the installation by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing `node -v`. This command will display the version number of Node.js if it's correctly installed.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Create a JavaScript File**:
   - Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
   - Create a new file named `polynomial.js`.
   - Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into this file.
   - Save the file.

2. **Navigate to the File Location**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved `polynomial.js`.
   - For example, if you saved the file on your desktop, you might use:
     ```bash
     cd Desktop
     ```

3. **Run the JavaScript File**:
   - Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js by running the following command:
     ```bash
     node polynomial.js
     ```
   - This command will invoke Node.js to execute the script.

4. **Verify the Output**:
   - The output, which is the calculated constant term of the polynomial, will be displayed in the terminal.
   - Check that the output matches the expected results based on the input JSON data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure Node.js is Properly Installed**:
  - If you encounter errors, make sure Node.js is correctly installed and the version is compatible.

- **Check for Syntax Errors**:
  - Ensure that the JavaScript code is free of syntax errors. Review the code if errors are reported by Node.js.

- **File Location**:
  - Verify that you are navigating to the correct directory where `polynomial.js` is saved.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the JavaScript code successfully and view the results as intended.
